Average Waiting Time: 14955.6
Average Turnaround Time: 38137.6
I would expect the average waiting time to be higher in SJF than in RR because many slower processes will have to wait for a (potentially) very long time due to being considered last, especially for a sample size of 10000.
I would expect the average turnaround time to be higher for RR than for SJF because RR is constantly switching.
